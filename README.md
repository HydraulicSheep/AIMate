# AIMate
Educating about game theory, AI and Deep Learning by visualising chess-bot thinking

## What is this?

AIMate is a project that aims to demystify the thinking of 'artificial intelligence' through the widely-played game of chess.

In its current form, it visualises minimax trees (with and without alpha-beta pruning) as well as bots that choose randomly.

In its current form, it is highly unfinished and more of a side-project.

## Future hopes:
* Neural Net Visualisation
* Proper move highlighting (and mini boards) on hover in the minimax tree
* Minimax tree coloured by side to move
* Speed optimisations
* Ability to play bots
* Ability to switch bot for situation evaluation
